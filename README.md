## Project Purpose:

With all the events occuring in our day to day lives, it can be difficult to remember the exhaustive list of birthdays for your colleagues, friends, family, acquaintances, business partners, etc.

To solve this dilemma, I created a simple Java application that sends an email reminder to each person you desire to send birthday wishes to. You must input your own email, and then input the email addresses of the people of interest. If it is no one's birthday, the program will wait until a person's birthday is the same day the program is ran.

This application can be coupled with Spring Boot to create a web application based off this project.
